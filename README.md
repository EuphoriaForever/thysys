<h3>About branches</h3>
<li>Master - for local repository (Isma's)</li>
<li>Main - for final output of the week/day </li>

<h3>Note that</h3>
A majority of the .py files (excpet main.py) are a bit outdated, I will try to update them in future changes. If you want to change them in your own local repo <br>
<li> Go to your cmd, make sure the filepath is on where your local repo is at</li>
<li> type the following (except the quotation marks) 'pyuic5 -x filename.ui -o filename.py' wherein filename.ui is the ui file you want to convert to a .py file</li>

<h3>To run the GUI</h3>
Simply go to main.py and run it in whatever text editor you are using. In fact you can literally just click on the main.py file itself
